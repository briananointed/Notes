# Notes-app
This is a project I worked on while learning android. You can add a note, save it and even delete the contents
I used Android Studio 3.1.3.
To import project, copy the link from clone or download and open new project from version control in AS.
You can also download the zip. Unzip the project, launch it on AS and it will download the necessary files.
